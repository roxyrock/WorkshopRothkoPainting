Key Concepts
CSS Box Model: The artwork is constructed by nesting and styling <div> elements using margins, padding, borders, and content boxes.

Positioning & Layout: Elements are centered and stacked within a framed container using margin, auto, and fixed widths.

Visual Styling: The aesthetic is enhanced using box-shadow, border-radius, transform (for subtle rotation), and filter: blur() to emulate a painted canvas texture.
